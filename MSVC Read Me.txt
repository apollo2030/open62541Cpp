The solution generated by CMake for MSVC 2015 doesn't work from the get go.
Here is what needs to be done before it can compile in Release, only (no luck with Debug):
* Make sure ws2_32.lib and iphlpapi.lib are included in each projects under Linker->Inputs->Additional Dependencies.
  If not it means they are missing from the CMakeCach.txt in the 2 following variables:
  * CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_LIBRARIES
  * CMAKE_C_STANDARD_LIBRARIES
* In all pojects, under C/C++->Preprocessor->Preprocessor Definitions define the preprocessor variables:
  * UA_DYNAMIC_LINKING_EXPORT
  * UA_ARCHITECTURE_WIN32 (optional, if left undefined it will be defined at compile time)
* Fix OBJS (renamed open62541cpp-object) project:
  * If Configuration Type is .lib, the C/C++->Code Generation->Runtime library should be set to /MT for Release, /MTd for Debug.
  * Add the filter Header Files and add the .h files from include
  * Optional Don't piss where you eat: Output Director(*.lib/*.dll) should be different from the Intermediat directory (*.obj)
* Fix open62541cpp project:
  * Set the target Extension to .lib
  * Set the Configuration Type to .lib
* Fix the example projects:
  * In C/C++->General->Additional Include Directories remove the duplicate:
     C:\Git\open62541Cpp\examples\DiscoveryServer\..\..\include, same as C:\Git\open62541Cpp\include
  * C/C++->Code Generation->Runtime library should be set to /MT for Release, /MTd for Debug.
  * In Linker->Inputs->Additional Dependencies, make sure ws2_32.lib and iphlpapi.lib are included.
  * In Linker->Inputs->Additional Dependencies, fix C:\Git\open62541\build\bin\Release\open62541.lib to ..\..\bin\$(Configuration)\open62541cpp.lib
                                                          ^^^^^^^^^                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Renaming OBJS project: when renaming the project OBJS to a new name, (ie: open62541cpp-object), you need to add it back as a dependecy in open62541cpp project
